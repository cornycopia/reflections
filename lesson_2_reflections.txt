What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
This sets up your directory as a git repository, and creates the .git folder which contains the metadata about it.
This is needed so that we can see the log/status/etc, as well as use the other git commands like diff/commit/etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediary between your working directory, and the files that are in the repository.
This allows you to specify which files you would like to add at a time, so that you can collate files into one "logical change" before submitting it.
